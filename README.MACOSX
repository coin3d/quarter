============================================================================

For building Quarter on macOS platform, you should in general follow the
instructions in the INSTALL file.

This file contains additional information about building Quarter on Mac OS X.
For more information on getting started, known issues, and more, see

============================================================================

Building Quarter should be straightforward: ./configure && make &&
sudo make install. See the file INSTALL for details. If any of these
stages fails, it's a bug in Quarter. Please let us know about this,
and we will be happy to fix it.

Please make sure that you have the latest version of Apple's developer
tools installed before building Quarter.

By default, Quarter will be set up as Mac OS X framework. Frameworks
are a concept central to Mac OS X, packing a dynamic shared library
with the necessary resources for this library, like header files,
images, and documentation. You can link against a framework by using
the "-framework" compiler option. 

What this means, basically, is that instead of "cc
-I/path/to/Coin/include -L/path/to/Coin/lib -lCoin -lGL -lGLU -o foo
foo.cpp", the commandline for building applications against Coin would
be something like this: "cc -framework Inventor -framework OpenGL -o
foo foo.cpp"

If you want to disable the creation of the framework and install
Quarter as standalone shared library, you can use the configure option

--without-framework

which will install libQuarter.dylib into $prefix/lib and the headers
into $prefix/include (/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include by
default).

The Qt Designer Plugin
======================

Quarter comes with a plugin for Qt Designer. On Mac OS X, this plugin
is installed by default in /usr/local/lib/designer. You'll have to set
the environment variable QT_PLUGIN_PATH to point to this directory:

export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib

The plugin has to reside in a directory named 'plugins' and the envvar
has to point to the directory above it, or Qt will not be able to find
it.

If you use the --prefix option with configure, the plugin will be
installed in <prefix>/lib/designer.

You can specify another install directory for the plugin by specifying
--with-qt-designer-plugin-path=<path>.

To verify that Quarter is installed properly, go to src/examples/ and
run the examiner executable. If the examiner example fails with the
assert 'could not find child QuarterWidget in ui file', double-check
that you have set the correct QT_PLUGIN_PATH

The Qt libtool problem
======================

If you have compiled and installed Qt yourself as a standalone shared
library (not as a framework), the libtool archive files produced are
usually buggy and can cause weird errors when linking the
examples. Just go to the directory where you installed Qt and remove
any *.la files there, you will not miss them.
