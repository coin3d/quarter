The ChangeLog file is intentionally not updated in the repository as this
information can be easily gathered through the revision control system.

Upon release, don't forget to fill the ChangeLog file through e.g.:
$ hg log --style=changelog -rtip:<PrevReleaseTag> > ChangeLog

(replace the optional <PrevReleaseTag> token with the tag for the previous release)
