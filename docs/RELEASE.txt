This document describes the process of making a new release of the Quarter
library.

Remember to include these points:

* Copy trunk to the corresponding tag, and do the rest of the changes
  in the tag

* When tagging the release in Subversion, make sure to edit the
  externals property to include the correct version of CMakeMacros.
  This probably includes modifying the svn:externals to point to a
  specific revision of the externals eg:
  $ svn propedit svn:externals  .
  CMakeMacros https://svn.coin3d.org/repos/CMakeMacros/trunk

  should change to:
  CMakeMacros -r <the current revision>   https://svn.coin3d.org/repos/CMakeMacros/trunk

  Remember to this for every external

* Update configure.ac in the tag with release version and commit

* Update configure.ac in trunk to point to next release version, but
  in alpha

* Bootstrap both trunk and tag.

* Run unittests

* Test example programs, and at least a few others.

* Test that doc generation looks reasonable..

* Commit and feel good!
