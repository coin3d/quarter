This document describes the process of making a new release of the Quarter

Remember to include these points:
o When tagging the release in Subversion, make sure to edit the externals property
  to include the correct version of CMakeMacros. This probably includes creating a
  new tag in CMakeMacros first.
  $ svn propedit svn:externals  .
